Run the following 2 lines of command in Powershell or bash or command prompt terminal to compile and link the source code(Make sure you have gnu tools installed):-

gcc sort_assgn_1.c heap_sort.c merge_sort.c quick_sort.c random.c -o a.exe
a.exe

The output will be stored in the out.txt file. Currently it's a csv format and the randomisation is currently the initial one which we decided.please change the sort_assgn_1.c file accordingly to change the order of randomisation.

Don't try to run the code in sublime or VS Code directly without configuring the default build files.

If you face difficulties feel free to contact me.
